DEPRECATED

Please don't use this mirror anymore! I've stopped keeping it up to date.

If you just want to set up unit tests for a plugin, use the [wp scaffold plugin-tests](http://wp-cli.org/blog/plugin-unit-tests.html) command from [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org) to create all the needed files automatically.

If you can't or don't want to use WP-CLI, just copy the files from the [sample plugin](https://github.com/wp-cli/sample-plugin).
